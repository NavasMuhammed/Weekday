## Features

- **React 18**: Utilizes the latest React features.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool with out-of-the-box support for HMR.
- **Redux Toolkit**: State management with Redux, simplified with the Redux Toolkit.
- **Material-UI**: A popular React UI framework for faster and easier web development.

git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
npm install
```

### Development

To start the development server, run:

```
npm run dev
```

This will launch the application in your default browser. Any changes you make to the source code will be immediately reflected in the browser without needing a page reload.

### Building for Production

```
npm run preview
```

### Code Quality

To lint the project, run:

```
npm run lint
```

This will check the code for any linting errors and enforce code style consistency.
